## FAQ
  - **What's Provably Fair ?**
    A hash is a message digest. It summarizes a message one way and is unpredictable. you can't find out what the original message was from a hash.
    Hashes are also tamper resistant, you just can't find another message that gives the same hash. This ensures that every round after cards are shuffled, they cannot be altered. We use SHA512 (Secure Hash Algorithm) provides hashes to maintain the fairness of all our games.
    For the detail, use /provably_help command in the chatbot.
  - **Why Text Mode ?**
    Security and privacy is the first consideration. The text mode will not expose media resources.(graphics, sound effects ...), servers are protected by the chatbot gateway and proxy layer.
    On the other hand, the text mode transfers data quickly and lightly so that you can synchronize game status without seams in all devices.
  - **Withdrawals**
    We thought it is our responsibility to make a rough statement of the rules of withdrawals at the beginning.(There will be slight differences depending on the chatbot)ã€‚
    1. Yes, we do have daily withdrawal limit.
    2. You must have at least one deposit record to do a withdrawal. However, we have no limit on the minimum deposit amount, so you can easily achieve this condition.
    3. The withdrawal fee will be charged. Mainly because we are very loose for the faucet function, please understand.
    4. The initial withdrawal will be done manually, which will delay you a little time. Deduct the situation of network traffic congestion, will be completed within 24 hours at the latest, but generally, less than 10 minutes.
  - **How to contact us**
    You can contact the Admin-Center via the /issue command in the chatbot and you will receive the reply within 24 hours.
